1. Characteristics of Big data

  There are 5 characteristics of big data.They are
   
  .Volume
  .Velocity
  .Variety
  .Veracity
  .Value
VOLUME   : The size of the data is referred as volume.There are various sources for
                     big data that leads to the increase in the amount of data with time.And
                     big data refers to large  amount of data and hence volume is an 
                     important characteristic  of big data
                  
VELOCITY : Velocity refers to speed of processing large amount of data.The amount 
                    of data grows with high speed and hence it becomes necessary to
                   process the data with high speed.

VARIETY    : There are different types of data which is referred as the varieties of 
                      data.They can be either structured or unstructured or semistructured.
                      Big data refers to handling with such varieties of data.

VERACITY  : The abnormality and the noise which is present in a data is called as 
                      Veracity.Veracity deals with analysis of the data in order to check 
                       whether only meaningful data is stored
VALUE        :  Value is a most important characteristic of big data.Large volume 
                       and variety of data forms the value of big data that can be accessed 
                      easily in order to deliver quality results.

2.Possible solutions to handle bigdata:

The possible solutions to handle bigdata are 
      .Scale up
      .Scale out.

SCALE UP: The process of adding resources to a single system in order to increase
                   its  configuration is known as scale up.
Disadvantages:
*Costly
*Time Consuming
*Complex

SCALE OUT: Multiple machines are added to an existing machine in order to 
                      distribute the loads of data among them to increase the performance.
                      Scale out is more reliable than scale in.

3.Difference between scaling up and scaling down:

SCALE UP : Scale up is used to increase the configuration of the single system by
                   adding resources  to the same system.Some limitations of sale up 
                   includes that it is complex,time consuming and also costly

SCALE OUT : Multiple machines are added to an existing machine is known as 
                       scale out.It is used tp  distribute the loads of data among them
                       to increase the performance.Scale out is more reliable than scale in.
